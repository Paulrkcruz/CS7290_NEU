Portfolio Piece

In Assignment 4, I chose to focus on Project Stinky. I have however chosen to focus on a different topic for my Term Project, which will be COVID-19 Data Visualization.
For the purpose of this assignment, I will go over my Assignment 4 Charts and tell the story that I found most interesting from the data.
