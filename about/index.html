Hey class! I am Paul Cruz, a Seattle native and MSCS student completing my final class (this class!)to graduate. I work as a Senior Bioinformatist in SarS-CoV2 NGS Pipeline development for clinical sequencing & variant discovery. Likely, you`ve seen my lab on the news (UW Medicine), as the media comes weekly and we discovered the first variants in Washington State.
On my off time from work, aside from being a full-time student and worker, I love to spend time with my Fiance and I`s pets Lily & Nikko, and travel the world. Thanks for stopping by and good luck this semester!
<br>
Paul
