Hey class! I am Paul Cruz, a Seattle native and MSCS student completing my final class (this class!)to graduate. I am a Senior Bioinformatist in Virology & NGS Pipeline development for Covid-19 clinical sequencing & variant discovery. Likely, you`ve seen my company on the news (UW Medicine) as we discovered the first variants in Washington State.
On my off time from work, aside from being a full-time student and worker, I love to spend time with my Fiance and I`s pets Lily & Nikko and traveling. Thanks for stopping by and good luck this semester!
<br>
Paul
